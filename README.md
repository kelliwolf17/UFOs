# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Dana create a table to display UFO sightings with several filter criteria at the same time.

## Results
If you open the webpage, you will automatically see all of the data provided displayed in the table. In order to filter through the data, you will have to make use of the filters.

Enter in a date, city, state abbreviation, country, or shape to filter through the data. There are place holders for each to show an example/format as to what to enter. You can enter in one or multiple filters at a time.

## Summary
While this webpage offers great information on UFO sightings, the filter functionality could be more refined. While you are able to filter the data based on the column headers, it does help you draw many conclusions from the data. I would recommend that that data be further sorted by year and graphics be made to store and show the data. This way one could compare and contrast over time to help determine if the sightings have increased or decreased over time. I would also like to see where most of the sightings have occurred. A map visual or bubble plot might help contextualize the data more. This way we could better determine hot spots of UFO sightings without having to guess cities until we found those with the greatest number of sightings.
