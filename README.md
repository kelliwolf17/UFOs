# UFOs

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Dana create a table to display UFO sightings with several filter criteria at the same time.

## Results
If you open the webpage, you will automatically see all of the data provided displayed in the table. In order to filter through the data, you will have to make use of the filters.

Enter in a date, city, state abbreviation, country, or shape to filter through the data. There are place holders for each to show an example/format as to what to enter. You can enter in one or multiple filters at a time.
